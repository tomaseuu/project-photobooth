# ðŸŒ¿ Luma Leaf â€“ An Online Photobooth

**Luma Leaf** is a full-stack web application that recreates the nostalgic charm of Korean-style photoboothsâ€”playful, self-service booths where friends take themed photostrips with cute borders and effects. This is my personal project, designed from scratch to bring that joyful experience online for anyone, anywhere.

## Why I Built It

Most photobooth web apps I found were cluttered, behind paywalls, or lacked personality. I wanted to build something:

- Minimal and clean
- Easy to use
- Free and fun for everyone

Luma Leaf reflects my love for memory-making, creativity, and design.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Custom server for photo processing, session handling, and download logic
- **Designs:** Built from Figma (dark and light mode)

## Key Features

- Snap a series of photos in sequence
- Apply borders, filters, and themes
- Download high-quality photostrips
- Smooth animations and responsive layout
- In progress: mobile layout, gallery view, photostrip customization

## What I Learned

This project helped me grow as a full-stack developer by teaching me:

- UI/UX design with attention to flow and detail
- Client-server architecture and photo rendering
- State management and animation handling in React
- Owning a product from ideation to near-deployment

## EVERYTHING IS IN PROGRESS RIGHT NOW
